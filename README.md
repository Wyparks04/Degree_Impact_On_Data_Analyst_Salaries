### 2. Project Overview 
```markdown 
## Project Overview 
 
This project analyzes job postings to compare salaries and requirements for positions with and without degrees.   
The goal is to provide clear, data‑driven insights into how degree requirements affect job opportunities and compensation.   
 
Once the project is running, users will see: 
- Cleaned datasets prepared for analysis 
- Visualizations showing salary distributions and trends 
- A narrative explanation of findings in plain language 
 
No coding background is required to understand the results — all outputs are explained clearly and supported by visuals. 


## 3. Technologies Used 
 
- **Python**: Core programming language for data analysis 
- **Pandas**: Used to clean and manipulate the dataset (handling missing values, feature engineering) 
- **SQL**: Applied for joins and structured queries to combine datasets 
- **Matplotlib**: Created visualizations to highlight salary trends and degree requirements 
- **Jupyter Notebook**: Provided a narrative‑driven environment to present both code and results 
- **Git/GitHub**: Version control and collaboration, ensuring reproducibility and transparency
